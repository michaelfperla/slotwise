## üèóÔ∏è Architecture Patterns

### Business Store Pattern
```typescript
// Zustand store with business operations
export const useBusinessStore = create<BusinessState>()(
  persist(
    (set, get) => ({
      // State management with automatic persistence
      createBusiness: async (businessData) => {
        // API call with error handling and notifications
      },
      // ... other operations
    }),
    { name: 'slotwise-business-storage' }
  )
);
```

### React Query Integration
```typescript
// Combined hook for business management
export function useBusiness(businessId?: string) {
  const businessStore = useBusinessStore();
  const myBusinessesQuery = useMyBusinesses();
  const servicesQuery = useBusinessServices(businessId || '');

  return {
    business: currentBusiness,
    services: servicesQuery.data,
    createBusiness: useCreateBusiness(),
    // ... other operations
  };
}
```

### Component Composition
```typescript
// Layout with nested components
<BusinessDashboardLayout>
  <BusinessDashboardOverview />
</BusinessDashboardLayout>

// Service management with modal forms
<ServiceManagement />
// Includes ServiceCard, ServiceForm, and Modal components
```

## üîß Usage Examples

### Business Dashboard Access
```typescript
// Automatic business loading and management
function DashboardPage() {
  const { business, services, isLoading } = useBusiness();
  
  if (!business) {
    return <OnboardingPrompt />;
  }
  
  return (
    <BusinessDashboardLayout>
      <BusinessDashboardOverview />
    </BusinessDashboardLayout>
  );
}
```

### Service Management
```typescript
// Complete service CRUD with real-time updates
function ServiceManagement() {
  const { services, createService, updateService, deleteService } = useBusiness();
  
  const handleCreateService = async (serviceData) => {
    await createService.mutateAsync(serviceData);
    // Automatic cache invalidation and UI updates
  };
}
```

### Business Onboarding
```typescript
// Multi-step onboarding with validation
function BusinessOnboarding() {
  const [currentStep, setCurrentStep] = useState(1);
  const createBusiness = useCreateBusiness();
  
  const handleBusinessSubmit = async (businessData) => {
    const business = await createBusiness.mutateAsync(businessData);
    setCurrentStep(2); // Move to service creation
  };
}
```
