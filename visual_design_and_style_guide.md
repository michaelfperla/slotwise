**SlotWise - Visual Design & Basic Style Guide Description**

**1. Overall Design Philosophy**

*   **Clean & Modern:** The UI should feel uncluttered, spacious, and contemporary. Avoid overly ornate or distracting elements.
*   **Trustworthy & Professional:** Especially for the business-facing aspects and payment processes, the design needs to inspire confidence.
*   **User-Friendly & Intuitive:** Building on the wireframes, the visual design should enhance usability. Clear visual hierarchy, affordances, and feedback are crucial.
*   **Accessible:** Adhere to accessibility best practices (e.g., sufficient color contrast, legible fonts, keyboard navigability considerations).
*   **Responsive:** The design must adapt seamlessly to various screen sizes (desktop, tablet, mobile).

**2. Color Palette**

*   **Primary Color (Brand Color):**
    *   **Teal/Aquamarine Blue:** (e.g., `#008080` or a slightly more modern variant like `#00A99D`). This color suggests efficiency, trust, and calmness, suitable for a scheduling platform.
    *   Usage: Main calls to action, active navigation elements, key icons, branding accents.
*   **Secondary Color:**
    *   **Dark Slate Gray / Off-Black:** (e.g., `#2F4F4F` or `#333333`).
    *   Usage: Body text, secondary information, less important UI elements.
*   **Accent Colors:**
    *   **A vibrant Coral or Orange:** (e.g., `#FF7F50` or `#FFA500`).
    *   Usage: Secondary CTAs, highlights, notifications, or to draw attention to specific features (use sparingly).
    *   **A calming Light Blue/Grey:** (e.g., `#ADD8E6` or `#E0E7EF`).
    *   Usage: Backgrounds for highlighted sections, disabled states, subtle dividers.
*   **Neutral Colors:**
    *   **White:** (e.g., `#FFFFFF`). For backgrounds of main content areas, cards.
    *   **Light Gray:** (e.g., `#F0F0F0` or `#F5F7FA`). For subtle backgrounds, input fields, borders.
    *   **Medium Gray:** (e.g., `#CCCCCC`). For inactive text, icons, dividers.
*   **State Colors:**
    *   **Success:** A clear Green (e.g., `#28A745` or `#00C851`). For confirmation messages, successful operations.
    *   **Error:** A distinct Red (e.g., `#DC3545` or `#FF4444`). For error messages, validation failures.
    *   **Warning:** An Amber/Yellow (e.g., `#FFC107` or `#FFBB33`). For warnings or important notices.
    *   **Information:** A calm Blue (e.g., `#17A2B8` or `#33B5E5`). For informational messages.

**5. Visual Distinction: Business Owner vs. Client-Facing**

*   **Business Owner Dashboard:**
    *   Slightly more data-dense and functional in appearance.
    *   Focus on clarity, efficiency, and information display (charts, tables, stats).
    *   Can use the Primary Brand Color more liberally for actions and navigation.
    *   May use more icons for actions to save space.
*   **Client-Facing Interface (Business Public Page & Booking Flow):**
    *   More emphasis on visual appeal and brand representation of the *business* using SlotWise (though SlotWise provides the framework).
    *   Larger imagery, more white space.
    *   Friendly and inviting tone.
    *   Primary Brand Color (Teal) used for SlotWise actions (e.g., "Book Now" buttons that are part of the SlotWise flow), but the business's own branding (logo, banner images) should be prominent.
    *   If a business can select a theme color, SlotWise elements should harmonize.
