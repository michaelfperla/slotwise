This directory contains the comprehensive development standards for the SlotWise project. These standards ensure consistency, maintainability, and quality across our microservices architecture.

## ðŸ“‹ Standards Overview

### Core Standards
- [Database Design](./database-design.md) - Schema design, migrations, and data modeling
- [API Design](./api-design.md) - REST API conventions and patterns
- [Testing Strategies](./testing-strategies.md) - Unit, integration, and E2E testing
- [Code Quality](./code-quality.md) - Linting, formatting, and best practices
- [Configuration Management](./configuration-management.md) - Environment variables and secrets

### Architecture Standards
- [Service Architecture](./service-architecture.md) - Microservices patterns and communication
- [Event-Driven Architecture](./event-driven-architecture.md) - NATS messaging patterns
- [Security Patterns](./security-patterns.md) - Authentication, authorization, and data protection
- [Error Handling](./error-handling.md) - Consistent error responses and logging

### Development Workflow
- [Git Workflow](./git-workflow.md) - Branching strategy and commit conventions
- [Code Review Guidelines](./code-review-guidelines.md) - PR review process and standards
- [Deployment Standards](./deployment-standards.md) - CI/CD and infrastructure patterns

## ðŸŽ¯ Quick Start

### For New Developers
1. Read [Service Architecture](./service-architecture.md) for system overview
2. Follow [Database Design](./database-design.md) for data modeling
3. Use [Testing Strategies](./testing-strategies.md) for writing tests
4. Apply [Code Quality](./code-quality.md) standards

### For New Services
1. Use service templates from `tools/templates/`
2. Follow [API Design](./api-design.md) conventions
3. Implement [Event-Driven Architecture](./event-driven-architecture.md) patterns
4. Set up [Configuration Management](./configuration-management.md)

## ðŸ”§ Enforcement

These standards are enforced through:
- **Pre-commit hooks** - Automated checks before commits
- **CI/CD pipelines** - Validation in GitHub Actions
- **Code review process** - Manual review against standards
- **Linting tools** - ESLint, golangci-lint, Prettier

## ðŸ“š Architecture Decision Records (ADRs)

Major architectural decisions are documented in the [ADRs](../adrs/) directory.

## ðŸš€ Contributing to Standards

Standards evolve with the project. To propose changes:
1. Create an issue for discussion
2. Submit a PR with proposed changes
3. Get approval from the architecture team
4. Update related tooling and templates

## ðŸ“ž Support

For questions about these standards:
- Create an issue with the `standards` label
- Discuss in the `#architecture` Slack channel
- Reach out to the architecture team
