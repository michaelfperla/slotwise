**SlotWise: High-Velocity Architecture Blueprint (Elite Team Edition)**

**Version:** 1.0-Alpha
**Date:** June 1, 2025
**Target Audience:** Elite Software Engineering Team
**Mandate:** Architect and build a hyper-performant, scalable, and rapidly evolvable MVP for SlotWise, focusing on best-in-class developer experience and future-proofing.

**1. Core Tenets (Reaffirmed for an Elite Context)**

*   **User-Obsessed Simplicity:** Even with advanced backend tech, the UX must remain brutally simple for solopreneurs and their clients. This is non-negotiable.
*   **Scalable Foundations from Day One:** Assume rapid growth. Design for horizontal scalability, fault tolerance, and low latency from the outset.
*   **Developer Velocity & Autonomy:** Empower the team with tools and patterns that maximize productivity and allow for parallel development with minimal friction.
*   **Data Integrity & Security:** No compromises. Implement robust security practices and ensure data consistency.
*   **Embrace Asynchronicity & Event-Driven Patterns:** For resilience and scalability of non-critical path operations.

**2. System Architecture: Decoupled & Event-Driven (MVP-Ready)**

While a monolith might be faster for smaller teams, a cracked team can handle a more decoupled approach from the start, anticipating future needs without premature over-optimization.

**Key Components & Rationale for an Elite Team:**

*   **2.1. Frontend SPA (TypeScript First):**
    *   **Tech:** React (with Next.js for SSR/SSG capabilities, performance) OR Vue 3 (with Nuxt.js). TypeScript is mandatory for type safety and large-scale maintainability.
    *   **State Management:** Zustand, Recoil, or Jotai (leaner, more modern than Redux for many use cases) OR well-managed Context API for simpler state.
    *   **Data Fetching:** TanStack Query (formerly React Query) / SWR for efficient data synchronization, caching, and optimistic updates.
    *   **Build/Dev Tools:** Vite for lightning-fast HMR and build times.
*   **2.2. API Gateway:**
    *   **Purpose:** Single entry point for all client requests. Handles routing, request/response transformation, rate limiting, initial auth token validation.
    *   **Tech:** AWS API Gateway, Kong, or a custom Nginx setup with Lua scripting. GraphQL (Apollo Server/Federation) preferred for flexible data fetching, reducing over/under-fetching. gRPC for internal service-to-service communication if high performance is critical.
*   **2.3. Authentication Service:**
    *   **Purpose:** Dedicated service for user authentication and token issuance.
    *   **Tech:** Leverage a managed service like Auth0 for rapid implementation and robust security OR build a custom service using OAuth2/OIDC standards with JWTs. Store only user IDs and hashed credentials.
*   **2.4. Core Backend Services (Microservices or Well-Defined Modules):**
    *   **Rationale:** Allows for independent scaling, deployment, and technology choices per service if beneficial (though consistency is good initially).
    *   **Language Choices (per service, based on domain & team strength):**
        *   **Go:** Excellent for high-concurrency, networked services (Scheduling, parts of API Gateway logic).
        *   **Rust:** Unmatched performance and memory safety, for computationally intensive tasks (if any emerge) or core critical path services.
        *   **Kotlin (with Spring Boot/Ktor) or Scala (with Akka/Play):** JVM power with modern language features, good for complex business logic.
        *   **Node.js (with TypeScript & Fastify/NestJS):** If I/O bound and team prefers JS ecosystem, but ensure rigorous performance testing.
    *   **Example Services:**
        *   **Scheduling Service:** Core logic for availability calculation, booking conflicts, etc. Highly optimized.
        *   **Business Service:** CRUD for User profiles, Service definitions, subdomain management.
        *   **Notification Service:** Manages communication (email, potentially SMS later) via external providers. Designed to be highly reliable and asynchronous.
*   **2.5. Primary Database:**
    *   **Tech:** **PostgreSQL.** For its robustness and rich feature set.
    *   **Scaling Strategy:** Start with a managed instance (AWS RDS, Google Cloud SQL). If extreme scale is anticipated early, consider distributed SQL options like YugabyteDB, CockroachDB, or Citus (extension for PostgreSQL) from the start for horizontal scalability and resilience, though this adds operational complexity.
    *   **ORM/Query Builder:** Prisma (type-safe), sqlc (generate type-safe Go from SQL), or jOOQ (Java) for type-safe SQL. Minimize heavy ORM magic for performance-critical queries.
*   **2.6. Event Store / Message Bus:**
    *   **Purpose:** Decouple services, handle asynchronous operations, enable event sourcing patterns if desired.
    *   **Tech:** Kafka, NATS.io, or Google Pub/Sub / AWS Kinesis. Use for events like `BookingCreated`, `PaymentProcessed`, `AvailabilityChanged`.
    *   **Impact:** Services subscribe to events they care about, enhancing resilience and allowing for new consumers (e.g., analytics) without modifying core services.
*   **2.7. Caching Layer:**
    *   **Tech:** Redis (or DragonflyDB as a high-performance alternative).
    *   **Use Cases:** Caching frequently accessed, rarely changing data (e.g., public business profiles, service lists), session data, rate limiting counters.
*   **2.8. External Integrations:**
    *   **Stripe:** Utilize Payment Intents API for modern, secure payment flows.
    *   **Cloudflare/Fastly:** For CDN, DDoS protection, WAF, and potentially edge compute for routing/caching.

**3. Data Flow & Key Interactions (Illustrative)**

*   **Booking Flow (Simplified for Event-Driven):**
    1.  Client (SPA) -> API Gateway (GraphQL Mutation `createBooking`)
    2.  API Gateway -> Auth Service (Verify Token)
    3.  API Gateway -> Scheduling Service (`createBooking` command)
    4.  Scheduling Service:
        *   Validates request.
        *   Atomically checks availability & reserves slot (e.g., using DB transaction with pessimistic locking or optimistic concurrency control).
        *   Persists tentative booking to Primary DB.
        *   Publishes `BookingTentativelyCreated` event to Event Store (contains booking ID, payment details if required).
    5.  Notification Service (subscribes to `BookingTentativelyCreated`):
        *   If payment required & successful (Stripe webhook might trigger another event `PaymentSucceeded`), sends confirmation email via SendGrid.
        *   If no payment or payment successful, could update booking status in DB or Scheduling Service could own final confirmation.
    6.  (Optional) Stripe Webhook -> API Gateway -> dedicated webhook processing service -> Publishes `PaymentSucceeded` or `PaymentFailed` event.
    7.  Scheduling Service (subscribes to `PaymentSucceeded`): Finalizes booking status to 'Confirmed' in DB. Publishes `BookingConfirmed` event.
    8.  Frontend can optimistically update UI upon initial request and then receive real-time updates via WebSockets (listening to events) or polling for final status.

**4. Infrastructure & DevOps (CI/CD & IaC Focus)**

*   **Containerization:** Docker for all services.
*   **Orchestration:** Kubernetes (EKS, GKE, AKS) for managing containerized applications. This team can handle it.
*   **Infrastructure as Code (IaC):** Terraform or Pulumi to define and manage all cloud resources.
*   **CI/CD:** GitHub Actions, GitLab CI, or Jenkins with highly automated pipelines for testing, building, and deploying services independently. Canary deployments / Blue-Green for zero-downtime releases.
*   **Monitoring & Observability:** Prometheus, Grafana, Jaeger/OpenTelemetry for distributed tracing, ELK Stack (Elasticsearch, Logstash, Kibana) or similar for centralized logging. Alerting via PagerDuty/Opsgenie.

**5. Development Process Expectations for This Team:**

*   **API Design First:** Use OpenAPI/gRPC Protobufs for clear service contracts.
*   **Comprehensive Automated Testing:** Unit, integration, and end-to-end tests are non-negotiable. High code coverage targets.
*   **Code Reviews:** Rigorous, constructive code reviews.
*   **Performance Benchmarking:** Regularly benchmark critical paths.
*   **Proactive Refactoring:** Continuously improve the codebase.
*   **Documentation:** Maintain concise, up-to-date technical documentation, especially for APIs and architectural decisions.
*   **Security by Design:** Integrate security practices throughout the development lifecycle. Static Analysis Security Testing (SAST) and Dynamic Analysis Security Testing (DAST) tools in CI.

**6. Core Trade-offs Being Made:**

*   **Complexity for Scalability/Flexibility:** This architecture is more complex than a simple monolith but provides a better foundation for long-term growth and independent service evolution.
*   **Operational Overhead:** Managing a distributed system (even with PaaS/Kubernetes) requires more operational expertise. This team is assumed to possess or rapidly acquire it.
*   **Initial Development Time:** Potentially slightly longer to set up the initial scaffolding for multiple services and event bus, but can lead to faster parallel development later.
