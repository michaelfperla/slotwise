# CI/CD Philosophy and Strategy

## **Our Approach: Simple, Fast, Effective**

This document explains our CI/CD strategy and the reasoning behind our decisions.

## **Core Principle: CI Should Help, Not Hinder**

**Goal:** Enable fast, confident development and deployment
**Anti-Goal:** Complex infrastructure that blocks productivity

## **What Our CI Checks**

### **✅ Essential Checks (Always Required)**
1. **Build Success** - `npm run build`
   - **Why:** Code must compile without errors
   - **Catches:** Syntax errors, missing imports, TypeScript errors
   - **Fast:** ~30 seconds

2. **Basic Tests** - `npm run test`
   - **Why:** Core business logic must work
   - **Catches:** Function logic errors, API contract violations
   - **Fast:** ~1-2 minutes

### **⚠️ Advisory Checks (Warning Only)**
3. **Linting** - `npm run lint`
   - **Why:** Consistent code quality
   - **Catches:** Code style issues, potential bugs
   - **Result:** Warning only, doesn't block merge

4. **Security Audit** - `npm audit`
   - **Why:** Known vulnerabilities
   - **Catches:** Dependency security issues
   - **Result:** Warning only, doesn't block merge

### **❌ Excluded from CI (Run Locally)**
- **Code Formatting** - `npm run format`
  - **Why:** Formatting conflicts block development unnecessarily
  - **Solution:** Run locally before committing
  - **Enforcement:** Pre-commit hooks (optional)

- **Integration Tests** - `npm run test:integration`
  - **Why:** Complex database/service setup is unreliable in CI
  - **Solution:** Run locally before merging
  - **Future:** Add when team grows beyond 5 people

- **End-to-End Tests**
  - **Why:** Slow and flaky, better suited for staging environment
  - **Solution:** Manual testing for MVP phase

## **Development Workflow**

### **Before Committing (Local)**
```bash
# 1. Format your code
npm run format

# 2. Check for issues
npm run lint

# 3. Ensure it builds
npm run build

# 4. Run relevant tests
npm run test

# 5. Commit and push
git add .
git commit -m "your message"
git push
```

### **CI Pipeline (Automatic)**
```bash
# 1. Install dependencies
npm ci

# 2. Generate required files
npm run prisma:generate:all

# 3. Build check
npm run build

# 4. Test check
npm run test

# 5. Advisory checks (warnings only)
npm run lint || echo "Linting issues found"
npm audit || echo "Security issues found"
```

## **Why This Approach?**

### **Speed and Reliability**
- **2-3 minute CI** instead of 15+ minutes
- **No database setup** = no infrastructure failures
- **No service dependencies** = no flaky tests

### **Developer Experience**
- **Fast feedback** on real issues
- **No blocked PRs** due to formatting
- **Clear separation** between blocking and advisory checks

### **Team Scalability**
- **New developers** can contribute immediately
- **Consistent standards** without enforcement friction
- **Easy to understand** and maintain

## **When to Evolve This Strategy**

### **Add Integration Tests to CI When:**
- Team size > 5 developers
- Multiple people working on same services simultaneously
- Integration bugs becoming frequent

### **Add Formatting Enforcement When:**
- Code reviews consistently mention formatting issues
- Team agrees on stricter enforcement

### **Add E2E Tests When:**
- Manual testing becomes bottleneck
- Customer-facing bugs increase
- Dedicated QA resources available

## **Current Status**

**Phase:** MVP Development
**Team Size:** 1-3 developers
**Priority:** Ship features fast with confidence
**CI Strategy:** Essential checks only

## **Scripts Reference**

### **Local Development**
```bash
npm run format          # Fix code formatting
npm run lint           # Check code quality
npm run typecheck      # Check TypeScript types
npm run build          # Build all services
npm run test           # Run unit tests
npm run test:integration # Run integration tests
```

### **CI Commands**
```bash
npm ci                 # Install exact dependencies
npm run build          # Verify code compiles
npm run test           # Verify core functionality
```

## **Questions?**

If you're unsure about any of these decisions or want to propose changes, please:
1. Open an issue for discussion
2. Reference this document in your proposal
3. Consider the team size and development phase

**Remember:** The best CI is the one that helps you ship features confidently and quickly.
