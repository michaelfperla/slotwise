# SlotWise Development Priorities

**Critical path to MVP launch** ðŸŽ¯

## ðŸš¨ **Immediate Blockers (Week 1)**

### 1. **Complete Booking Flow Implementation**
**Priority: CRITICAL** ðŸ”´

**Current State**: Basic booking models exist, no end-to-end flow
**Needed**:
```bash
# Scheduling Service (Go)
- POST /api/v1/bookings (create booking)
- GET /api/v1/bookings/:id (get booking details)
- PUT /api/v1/bookings/:id/status (update booking status)
- GET /api/v1/services/:id/availability (get available slots)

# Business Logic
- Availability calculation algorithm
- Conflict detection and prevention
- Booking state management
- NATS event publishing for booking events
```

**Acceptance Criteria**:
- [ ] Customer can create a booking for an available slot
- [ ] System prevents double-booking conflicts
- [ ] Booking confirmation with unique ID
- [ ] Events published to NATS for downstream services

### 2. **Frontend Booking Interface**
**Priority: CRITICAL** ðŸ”´

**Current State**: Basic Next.js shell, no functional UI
**Needed**:
```bash
# Core Pages
- /[subdomain] (business landing page)
- /[subdomain]/book/[serviceId] (booking flow)
- /[subdomain]/book/confirm (booking confirmation)
- /dashboard (business owner dashboard)
- /bookings (customer booking management)

# Components
- ServiceCard component
- TimeSlotPicker component
- BookingForm component
- PaymentForm component (basic)
```

**Acceptance Criteria**:
- [ ] Customer can browse services on business page
- [ ] Customer can select available time slots
- [ ] Customer can complete booking form
- [ ] Booking confirmation page displays

### 3. **Basic Payment Processing**
**Priority: HIGH** ðŸŸ¡

**Current State**: Payment types defined, no implementation
**Needed**:
```bash
# Payment Service (New - TypeScript/Node.js)
- POST /api/v1/payments/intents (create payment intent)
- POST /api/v1/payments/confirm (confirm payment)
- Stripe integration for card processing
- Webhook handling for payment events

# Frontend Integration
- Stripe Elements integration
- Payment form component
- Payment confirmation flow
```

**Acceptance Criteria**:
- [ ] Customer can enter payment details
- [ ] Payment processing with Stripe
- [ ] Payment confirmation updates booking status
- [ ] Payment events published to NATS

## ðŸ”§ **Core Infrastructure Gaps (Week 1-2)**

### 4. **Email Notification Implementation**
**Priority: HIGH** ðŸŸ¡

**Current State**: Templates defined, no sending logic
**Needed**:
```bash
# Notification Service Enhancement
- SendGrid integration for email sending
- NATS event subscribers for booking events
- Template rendering with dynamic data
- Email delivery tracking

# Email Templates
- Booking confirmation email
- Booking reminder email
- Payment confirmation email
```

### 5. **Database Seeding & Test Data**
**Priority: MEDIUM** ðŸŸ¢

**Current State**: âœ… COMPLETED - Added seed script
**Status**: Ready for use

### 6. **API Integration Testing**
**Priority: MEDIUM** ðŸŸ¢

**Current State**: âœ… COMPLETED - Added test script
**Status**: Ready for use

## ðŸ“‹ **Development Workflow Improvements**

### 7. **Environment Configuration**
**Priority: MEDIUM** ðŸŸ¢

**Needed**:
```bash
# Missing Environment Files
- services/auth-service/.env.example
- services/scheduling-service/.env.example
- frontend/.env.example

# Configuration Management
- Centralized config validation
- Environment-specific settings
- Secret management for production
```

### 8. **Error Handling & Logging**
**Priority: MEDIUM** ðŸŸ¢

**Current State**: Basic error handling exists
**Improvements Needed**:
```bash
# Standardized Error Responses
- Consistent error format across all services
- Proper HTTP status codes
- User-friendly error messages
- Correlation ID tracking

# Enhanced Logging
- Structured logging with correlation IDs
- Request/response logging
- Performance metrics
- Error tracking integration
```

## ðŸŽ‰ **You're Almost There!**

The foundation is solid. With focused effort on these priorities, you'll have a functional MVP in 1-2 weeks. The architecture is sound, the infrastructure is ready, and the development tools are in place.

**Focus on the booking flow first** - everything else builds on that core functionality.
