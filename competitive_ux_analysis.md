**Overall Summary & Key Takeaways for SlotWise:**

*   **Guided Onboarding for Businesses:** Business owners need a guided, step-by-step onboarding process. Start simple and allow progressive disclosure of more advanced features (lessons from Calendly & Acuity).
*   **Customization for Businesses:** Allow businesses to customize their public-facing page and aspects of the booking flow (e.g., intake forms, branding) to a reasonable extent (lessons from Acuity).
*   **Robust but Usable Business Tools:** Business owners need powerful tools for managing services, staff, schedules, and clients. The challenge is to make these tools comprehensive yet intuitive (lessons from Acuity & OpenTable's business side).
*   **Clear Value Proposition:** From the moment a user lands on SlotWise (either as a potential business user or a client), the value proposition should be clear.
*   **Mobile-First Considerations:** Both client and business owner interfaces should be designed with mobile usability in mind, even if some complex admin tasks are better on desktop.
*   **Performance and Reliability:** All benchmarked platforms are generally performant and reliable; this is a table stake.
*   **Opportunity for Differentiation:** SlotWise can differentiate by combining the ease of Calendly's booking with the business-specific depth of Acuity, potentially serving a broader range of service types with a more modern UI than some established players.
