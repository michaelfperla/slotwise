### ⚠️ Issues Identified and Corrected

#### 1. Technology Stack Mismatches
**File**: `docs/adrs/002-microservices-architecture.md`
- **Issue**: Documented all services as Go, but business-service and notification-service are TypeScript/Node.js
- **Action**: Updated technology stack section to reflect actual implementation
- **Impact**: Critical accuracy improvement

#### 2. Non-existent Service References
**File**: `docs/api-documentation.md`
- **Issue**: Referenced Payment Service and API Gateway that don't exist yet
- **Action**: Updated base URLs, removed payment service from TOC, added implementation status notes
- **Impact**: Prevents developer confusion

#### 3. Inaccurate API Documentation URLs
**File**: `README.md`
- **Issue**: Claimed all services have Swagger docs when only business-service does
- **Action**: Updated API documentation section with accurate status
- **Impact**: Sets correct expectations for developers

#### 4. Outdated Frontend Documentation
**File**: `frontend/README.md`
- **Issue**: Default Next.js template, not SlotWise-specific
- **Action**: Completely rewrote with SlotWise-specific content
- **Impact**: Provides useful frontend development guidance

#### 5. Overstated Features in Changelog
**File**: `CHANGELOG.md`
- **Issue**: Listed features that don't exist yet (API Gateway, Payment Integration, etc.)
- **Action**: Updated to reflect actual current implementation status
- **Impact**: Accurate project status representation

### 🗑️ Redundant Content Removed

#### 1. Duplicate Event-Driven Architecture Documentation
**File Removed**: `docs/event-driven-architecture.md`
- **Reason**: Duplicate of more comprehensive `docs/standards/event-driven-architecture.md`
- **Action**: Removed duplicate, updated all references to point to standards version
- **Impact**: Eliminates confusion, maintains single source of truth
